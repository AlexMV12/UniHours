# UniHours
Little Java app to store and display university time tables, providing a JavaFX Gui.

The time table is saved in a simple JSON file ( timetable.json in the repo is an example).

Features:
1. Show a timetable with personalized colour for each subjects
2. Show the room in which the lesson will be taken (TODO)
3. Let the user create a new table with the support of the GUI, without the need to touch the JSON (TODO)
4. Let the user personalize the subjects adding the name of the teacher and other infos. (TODO)
